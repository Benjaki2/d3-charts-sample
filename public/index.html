  <h2>Obesity in teens and young adults in The United States</h2>
  <p>By <a href="benkingportfolio.herokuapp.com"> Benjamin A. King</a></p>
  <p>
    This visualization represents mean percentage values of obesity and overweight people in the United States for year 2013. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The visualization was created to show how the percentage of obesity in the U.S. fluctuates between adolescence and young adulthood. The visualization suggests that obesity levels rise significantly for women during their college years, in comparison to men. As the number of female undergraduates continues to rise... this noticeable increase could suggest a correlation between weight gain and the college experience.
